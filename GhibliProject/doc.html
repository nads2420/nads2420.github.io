        I used the Ghibli Api https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/.
        I imported a font named Ghibki from https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/alsamman/ghibli/#:~:text=Inspired%20by%20the%20Studio%20Ghibli's,sharpness%2C%20characterization%2C%20and%20modernization.
        API: At first, I wanted to show both details about the movie and the characters in the movie,
         but I couldn't find a way to seperate characters from films. On the website, there are code snippets to get all the species or people
         in the entirety of Ghibli, but it was difficult to retrieve and originally I wanted to show the image with the character
         but I would have to find all the images.
         I got all of the images from the Ghibli movie screencaps + the movie covers. I found that I had to use the same img format to be able to
         use the images in an array. I also had to name them the same as their movie titles and remove the spaces to get the images. Other
         data i got from the API were the descriptions,directors,ratings,producers, and release dates. I found it easy to add them all to arrays
         where I could update the website's info with a current index.

         Local Storage: The local storage does save the last term when I had tested.

         Controls: I implemented the search control, a sort by a-z,z-a control and previous and next buttons. They all seem to work.
